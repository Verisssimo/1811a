                <p><strong>Data:</strong>June 15, 1976</p>
                <p><strong>Status:</strong>CONFIDENTIAL</p>
                <p><strong>Descrição:</strong>The Nimbus Project was initiated in response to rising international tensions. The goal is to develop a vehicle capable of traversing dimensional barriers for exploration and strategic control. The chosen prototype is a blue Beetle, modified with antineutrino technology. Initial tests are scheduled for the third quarter of 1976. Results are unpredictable.</p>

                <p><strong>Descrição:</strong>Despite the delays, the project has proven to be a true success. The creation of Nimbus was accomplished with great effort from the scientific community and shows promising results. The first tests will be conducted in a few months, as some in the community have reported inconclusive events with the new antineutrino technology. This raises concerns for some, but the project will continue full steam ahead. Please increase our budget for the next quarter.</p>
